# Twitter-real-time-sentiment-analysis

Project set-up:

${Virtual \ env:}$

- Create the virtual-env:
run "python -m venv venv"
- Activate the virtual-env:
run "source venv/bin/activate"
- Deactivate the virtual-env:
run "deactivate"
- Manage packages (after activating the venv):
to install a package >> run "pip install <package>" 
to uninstall a package >> run "pip uninstall <package>"
to get the list of the packages >> run "pip list"

# Current state

We may not be able to gather tweets directly from XAPI (the free dv account is very limited). Maybe we can use scrapping like described in this website :https://blog.apify.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-and-more-on-twitter-59330e6fb522/

DO NOT FORGET TO CITE SOURCES

# Bonus
### Ideas for the note book :
- real time tweets on a map like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd-zgQUzxY8
- real time analysis (sentiment and topic analysis) like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1inu-AtcUXM
- real time opinion analysis (on some precise query)
